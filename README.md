The linear stability of plane Poiseuille flow is studied by examining the solution to the
Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem by the implementation of two numerical methods.
The numerical schemes utilised are that of finite-difference methods and spectral methods, where it is shown that the spectral-tau method obtains very accurate results more
economically in comparison to a second-order central-difference scheme employed. A local iterative method derived from the second-order finite-difference scheme is utilised to
obtain approximations to the least stable eigenvalue with the use of an estimated guess
and a corrector. These numerical schemes are compared in terms of their accuracy, order
of convergence and computational expense by comparison of the numerical results produced. The spectral approach is also applied to a hybrid plane Poiseuille-Couette flow,
where the boundaries are allowed to move tangentially relative to each other, the results
of which are commented on in this work.

The MATLAB code shared here is used to solve the Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem by the implementation of two numerical schemes in finite-difference and spectral methods. The code also generates plots of the eigenspectra allowing for visual analysis of the linear stability and consequently physical interpretation of the numerical solution.
